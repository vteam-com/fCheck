- Update the README.md and RULES if needed
- Update the sequence_diagram.svg if the system flow has changed
- NO MAGIC NUMBERS
- ALWAYS EXTRACT NUMERIC LITERALS INTO NAMED CONSTANTS (file-level `const`), except canonical sentinel values `-1`, `0`, and `1` when they are semantically obvious
- NO DEAD CODE
